# IMS
Inventory Management System


## 'record.json'  is the file with the previous amount of goods
## 'sales.json'  is the file with the updated amount of goods after shopping 




This is the complete Inventory Management Setup. Here first of all it takes number of total items the person wants to buy, accordingly the loop will run that much time
We get id numbers of every products from the barcode scanner.

Then the user put how many items of that product he/she wants to buy.

If the requirement is greater than the amount of the current product amount, then it will return a message"out of stock", and assume that value as '0'. 

You will get autonatically flat 20% discount if you shop above 2000

You will get autonatically flat 40% discount if you shop above 5000

At the end it gives the total amount of the bill. with the current stock of goods available at the shop
